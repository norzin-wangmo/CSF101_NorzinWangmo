# Reflection on Practical 5

This file contains my reflections on the topics covered in the Practical 5 folder. For each topic, I wrote what I learned, the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them. 

*Note: I sincerely apologize for not including screenshots of the problems I faced during this practical. At the time, I was focused on solving the issues and did not think to capture them. I understand that screenshots can greatly help in illustrating challenges and solutions, and I truly appreciate your understanding. I will make it a priority to include relevant screenshots in all future submissions to enhance clarity and learning.*

## 1. Binary Search Tree
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to implement a binary search tree (BST) in Python, including insertion and search methods.
- Practiced BST implementation in excercise.py, reinforcing concepts of recursion and tree traversal.
#### Challenges Faced
- Faced difficulties with recursive insertion and handling edge cases in search.
- In excercise.py, encountered issues with tree balancing and debugging recursive functions.
#### How I Overcame Them
- Practiced with different tree structures and wrote helper functions to visualize the tree.
- Used print statements and step-by-step debugging in excercise.py to understand tree operations.

## 2. Graph Data Structure and Traversal Algorithms
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to implement a graph using adjacency lists and perform DFS and BFS traversals.
- Practiced graph algorithms in excercise_2.py, including weighted and unweighted graphs, and shortest path algorithms.
#### Challenges Faced
- Found it challenging to keep track of visited nodes and handle cycles in the graph.
- In excercise_2.py, faced issues with graph edge cases and debugging traversal algorithms.
#### How I Overcame Them
- Used sets to track visited nodes and tested with various graph examples.
- Used print statements and step-by-step debugging in excercise_2.py to understand the flow of algorithms.

##  Overall Reflection
Practical 5 helped me understand advanced data structures like binary search trees and graphs. By implementing and testing these structures, I improved my problem-solving and coding skills.

### Future Improvements
- I want to practice more problems involving trees and graphs, including more complex algorithms.
- I plan to explore shortest path algorithms and graph theory in future exercises.
