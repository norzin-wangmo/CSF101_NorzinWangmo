# Reflection on Practical 2

This file contains my reflections on the topics covered in the Practical 2 folder. For each topic, I wrote what I learned, the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them. 

*Note: I sincerely apologize for not including screenshots of the problems I faced during this practical. At the time, I was focused on solving the issues and did not think to capture them. I understand that screenshots can greatly help in illustrating challenges and solutions, and I truly appreciate your understanding. I will make it a priority to include relevant screenshots in all future submissions to enhance clarity and learning.*

## 1. Fibonacci
### 1.1 Iterative Approach
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to implement the Fibonacci sequence using loops.
#### Challenges Faced
- Sometimes made mistakes in updating variables, leading to incorrect results.
#### How I Overcame Them
- Used print statements to check values at each step and practiced with examples.

### 1.2 Recursive Approach
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to implement the Fibonacci sequence using recursion and the importance of base cases.
#### Challenges Faced
- Found it confusing to trace recursive calls and sometimes forgot proper base cases.
#### How I Overcame Them
- Drew diagrams to visualize recursion and added print statements to see the order of execution.

##  Overall Reflection
Practical 2 helped me understand both iterative and recursive approaches to solving problems. By practicing both methods, I improved my logical thinking and coding skills.

### Future Improvements
- I want to practice more problems using both iterative and recursive methods.
- I plan to compare the efficiency of different approaches in future exercises.
