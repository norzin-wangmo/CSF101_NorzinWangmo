This is a simple algorithm to
# calculate the area of a rectangle,
# given its length and width.
# The algorithm is written in pseudocode
# and is intended to be easy to understand
# and follow.
# The algorithm is structured as follows:
# 1. Input the length and width of the rectangle
# 2. Calculate the area by multiplying length and width
# 3. Output the calculated area
INPUT length
INPUT width
area = length * width
OUTPUT area
# End of the pseudocode algorithm
