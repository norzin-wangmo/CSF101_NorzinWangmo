# Reflection on Practical 3

This file contains my reflections on the topics covered in the Practical 3 folder. For each topic, I wrote what I learned, the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them. 

*Note: I sincerely apologize for not including screenshots of the problems I faced during this practical. At the time, I was focused on solving the issues and did not think to capture them. I understand that screenshots can greatly help in illustrating challenges and solutions, and I truly appreciate your understanding. I will make it a priority to include relevant screenshots in all future submissions to enhance clarity and learning.*

## 1. Queue
### 1.1 Queue Implementation
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to implement a queue using a class in Python.
#### Challenges Faced
- Sometimes forgot to handle the case when the queue is empty, which led to errors.
#### How I Overcame Them
- Wrote test cases to check different scenarios, including empty queues.

## 2. Stack
### 2.1 Stack Implementation
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to implement a stack using a class in Python.

##  Overall Reflection
Practical 3 helped me understand fundamental data structures like queues and stacks. By implementing and testing them, I improved my problem-solving and coding skills.

### Future Improvements
- I want to practice more problems involving stacks and queues.
- I plan to explore more advanced data structures in future exercises.
