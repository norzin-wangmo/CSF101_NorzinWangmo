# Reflection on Practical1_Unit3Exercises

This file contains my reflections on the topics covered in the **Practical1_Unit3_exercises** folder. For each topic, I wrote what I learned, the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them.

## 1. Linked Lists
### What I Learned
- Learned about the concept of linked lists and how they differ from arrays.
- Practiced creating nodes and connecting them to form singly linked lists.
- Understood how to traverse and manipulate linked lists in Python.

### Challenges Faced
- Initially, I found it difficult to visualize how nodes are connected and how pointers work.
- Sometimes I made mistakes in updating the next pointers, which broke the list.

### How I Overcame Them
- I drew diagrams to help me understand the structure of linked lists.
- By writing small programs and testing different cases, I improved my understanding of node connections.

## 2. Reversing a Linked List
### What I Learned
- Learned how to reverse a singly linked list using iteration.
- Understood the importance of updating pointers carefully to avoid losing access to nodes.
- Practiced writing code to reverse the list and verify the result.

### Challenges Faced
- At first, I struggled to keep track of previous, current, and next nodes during reversal.
- Sometimes I ended up with broken lists due to incorrect pointer updates.

### How I Overcame Them
- I used print statements to check the values of pointers at each step.
- Practiced with different examples until I was confident in reversing linked lists.

## 3. Practical Exercises
### What I Learned
- Applied concepts of linked lists to solve practical problems in Python.
- Practiced writing functions to insert, delete, and search nodes in a list.
- Improved my problem-solving skills by working through exercises in the practical files.

### Challenges Faced
- Some exercises required careful planning and debugging to get the correct output.
- I sometimes made mistakes in edge cases, such as empty lists or single-node lists.

### How I Overcame Them
- I reviewed my code and tested with different inputs to find and fix errors.
- By practicing regularly, I became more comfortable with linked list operations.

## 4. Stack (Practical 1 - Part 1)
### What I Learned
- Learned how to implement a stack data structure using a Python class.
- Practiced writing methods for push, pop, peek, and checking if the stack is empty.
- Understood the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle and how it applies to stack operations.

### Challenges Faced
- Sometimes I made mistakes when popping or peeking from an empty stack, which caused errors.
- It was tricky to keep track of the top element after multiple operations.

### How I Overcame Them
- I added error handling to manage empty stack cases.
- By testing with different sequences of operations, I became more confident in using stacks.

---

## 5. Queue (Practical 1 - Part 2)
### What I Learned
- Learned how to implement a queue data structure and perform enqueue and dequeue operations.
- Practiced using lists and collections to manage the queue in Python.
- Understood the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle and its importance in queue operations.

### Challenges Faced
- Sometimes I confused the order of elements and made mistakes in managing the front and rear of the queue.
- Handling edge cases like empty queues required careful attention.

### How I Overcame Them
- I wrote test cases to check the behavior of the queue after each operation.
- Practiced with different examples to understand how queues work in real scenarios.

## Note on Screenshots
I would like to mention that I was unable to include screenshots for this unit, as I forgot to capture them during my work on the exercises. I sincerely apologize for this oversight. In future practicals, I will make sure to take and attach relevant screenshots to better illustrate my learning process and progress. Thank you for your understanding.

## Overall Reflection
This unit helped me understand data structures at a deeper level, especially linked lists. The practical exercises challenged me to think logically and debug my code. By working step by step and practicing regularly, I improved my coding skills and confidence.

### Future Improvements
- I want to learn more about other types of linked lists, such as doubly and circular linked lists.
- I plan to practice more advanced operations, like merging and sorting linked lists.
- I will continue solving exercises to master data structures and algorithms.
