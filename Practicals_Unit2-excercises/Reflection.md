# Reflection on Practical1_Unit2Exercises

This file contains my reflections on the topics covered in the **Practical1_Unit2_exercises** folder.  
For each topic, I wrote what I learned, the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them. However, i could not attach any screenshots as I
forgot to do so during that moment and sincerely spologize for that and promise to do so from next time

## 1. Basics
### What I Learned
- Understood fundamental concepts such as numbers, strings, booleans, and type conversions.
- Practiced writing simple Python programs to handle user inputs and outputs.

### Challenges Faced
- At first, I struggled with remembering the correct syntax for type conversions (e.g., `int()`, `str()`, `float()`).
- Sometimes I mixed up when to use single quotes vs double quotes in strings.

### How I Overcame Them
- I wrote small practice programs andtried to to remind myself of the correct syntax.
- By practicing repeatedly, I became more confident in converting between types and working with strings.

## 2. Data Structures
### What I Learned
- Learned how to use lists, dictionaries, and sets.
- Practiced storing, updating, and retrieving data efficiently.

### Challenges Faced
- I found it confusing to remember the difference between lists and dictionaries at first.
- Also, I sometimes forgot that lists are ordered while sets are not.
- I even messed up using different brackets during that time.

### How I Overcame Them
- I solved small exercises like adding items to a list, updating dictionaries, and checking membership in sets.
- Comparing real-life examples (like a “shopping list” for lists vs “student record” for dictionaries) helped me understand the difference.
- Due to using time and again i finally adjusted to knowing which bracket to use when.

## 3. Control Structures
### What I Learned
- Practiced using `if`/`else`, `for` loops, and `while` loops.
- Learned how to use `break` and `continue` to control loop behavior.

### Challenges Faced
- Sometimes I ended up with infinite loops when I forgot to update loop variables.
- I was confused about when to use `for` vs `while`.

### How I Overcame Them
- I used print statements inside loops to check what was happening.
- I practiced different problems until I understood that `for` is best for a known range, while `while` is for conditions that depend on logic.

## 4. Flowcharts and Pseudocode
### What I Learned
- Learned to express algorithms in pseudocode and visualize them with flowcharts.
- Understood how to structure problems step by step before coding.
- learned to draw by hand.
- learned to paste pictures in vs code.

### Challenges Faced
- At first, I wrote pseudocode too much like Python code, forgetting it should be plain and easy to read.
- I also found it tricky to connect shapes correctly in flowcharts.

### How I Overcame Them
- I reviewed examples from class and followed a consistent structure (Input → Process → Output).
- Practicing with simple problems like “area of a rectangle” helped me improve.

## 5. Functions
### What I Learned
- Learned to write functions with parameters and return values.
- Understood local vs global variables and the importance of scope.

### Challenges Faced
- Sometimes I forgot to use `return` when I needed a value back from a function.
- I was confused when variables with the same name existed inside and outside a function.

### How I Overcame Them
- I wrote test functions and printed results to see what was happening.
- I used clear variable names and practiced writing functions for small problems.

---

## 6. Arithmetic and Comparisons
### What I Learned
- Practiced arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) and comparison operators (<, >, ==, !=).
- Applied them in conditions and loops to solve problems.

### Challenges Faced
- I sometimes forgot the difference between `=` (assignment) and `==` (comparison).
- Division in Python gave float results, which confused me when I expected integers.

### How I Overcame Them
- I solved practice problems with both assignment and comparison to get used to them.
- I learned to use `//` for integer division when needed.

---

## Overall Reflection
This unit helped me build a strong foundation in Python programming. Each topic connected to the next, making it easier to understand bigger problems. At times I felt challenged, especially with loops and functions, but by practicing step by step, I improved my logical thinking and coding skills.

### Future Improvements
- I want to practice writing more programs that combine all these topics together.
- I plan to create more flowcharts and pseudocode before coding to avoid mistakes.
- I will continue solving small exercises until I feel completely confident.
- I also plan to learn more regarding all this topics and mastering it.
