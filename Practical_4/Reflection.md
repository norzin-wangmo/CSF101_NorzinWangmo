# Reflection on Practical 4

This file contains my reflections on the topics covered in the Practical 4 folder. For each topic, I wrote what I learned, the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them. 

*Note: I sincerely apologize for not including screenshots of the problems I faced during this practical. At the time, I was focused on solving the issues and did not think to capture them. I understand that screenshots can greatly help in illustrating challenges and solutions, and I truly appreciate your understanding. I will make it a priority to include relevant screenshots in all future submissions to enhance clarity and learning.*

## 1. Linked Lists
### 1.1 Singly Linked List
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to implement a singly linked list in Python using classes.
#### Challenges Faced
- Made mistakes in updating next pointers, which led to broken lists.
#### How I Overcame Them
- Wrote helper functions to print the list and check its structure.

### 1.2 Reverse Linked List
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to reverse a singly linked list by updating pointers.
#### Challenges Faced
- Found it confusing to update pointers correctly without losing nodes.
#### How I Overcame Them
- Drew diagrams to help understand the reversal process and practiced with helper functions.

## 2. Leet Code Problems
### 2.1 Merging Lists
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted list using pointer manipulation.
#### Challenges Faced
- Needed to carefully update pointers to avoid losing nodes and ensure the merged list was sorted.
#### How I Overcame Them
- Used a dummy node and helper functions to test and debug the merging process.

### 2.2 Removing Nth Node from End
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to remove the nth node from the end of a linked list using two-pointer technique.
#### Challenges Faced
- Found it tricky to handle edge cases, such as removing the head or last node.
#### How I Overcame Them
- Practiced with different test cases and used a dummy node to simplify pointer updates.

### 2.3 Reverse Linked List (LeetCode)
#### What I Learned
- Reinforced my understanding of reversing a linked list by iteratively updating pointers.
#### Challenges Faced
- Needed to ensure all pointers were updated correctly to avoid breaking the list.
#### How I Overcame Them
- Used helper functions and step-by-step debugging to verify the reversal process.

##  Overall Reflection
Practical 4 helped me understand linked lists and how to manipulate them. By implementing and reversing lists, I improved my understanding of pointers and data structures.

### Future Improvements
- I want to practice more problems involving linked lists and their variations.
- I plan to explore more complex operations on linked lists in future exercises.
